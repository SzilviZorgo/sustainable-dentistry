# Subdirectory: Deductive

For your study, you may not want to develop codes inductively from the data, but adopt and/or modify an existing code scheme. If you adopt the code scheme without modifying it, provide a link to the codebook you employed. If you modify them in any way, you may want to include a document here to specify the changes you have made and their justifications.

# Subdirectory: Inductive

You may be developing codes from the data, which may take many iterations. If there are multiple coders, each may receive a subdirectory, where they can house their own initial codebook (in subdirectory "CodeDev--Round_1"), and in a separate subdirectory, the triangulated (and merged) tentative codebook(s) can be housed per round (Triangulation--Round_1). There is an empty SQAFFOLD document for the meeting notes.

# Codebook templates

There are three codebook templates (one flat and two hierarchical code structures) available here: https://osf.io/mbsdg
And an extended codebook template here: https://osf.io/m4bsa

# Merging codebooks

If you require guidance or ideas on how to merge two or more codebooks through accommodation and assimilation, there are some available here: https://osf.io/9qzfe
