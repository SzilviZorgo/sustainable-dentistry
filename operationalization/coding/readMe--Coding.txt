# Subdirectory: Coder-training
One or multiple coders may be performing coding; in both cases, it may be beneficial to make note of how coding should be performed. For multiple coders, there may be a training to educate coders and help them practice coding subsets of the data. This subdirectory is for such instructions, materials, and reflections on the process.

# Subdirectory: Final-codebook
You may want to have a "living codebook" until the end of the coding process, even after you have finalized the codes (but continue to refine definitions and/or add examples). In this case, the living document can be downloaded (e.g., from a collaborative space) in various stages and placed into this subdirectory. And/or the final version of the codebook can be housed here.
