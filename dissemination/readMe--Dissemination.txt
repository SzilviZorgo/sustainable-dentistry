# Subdirectory: Manuscripts
This is a subdirectory for manuscripts you are working on. You may want to place it in the "private" directory if you do not want them to be public.

Once you have created (and submitted) a manuscript, you may want to make it publicly accessible via a preprint server. Here are some ideas for where to upload:

PsyArXiv
https://psyarxiv.com

SocArXiv
https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv

Zenodo
https://zenodo.org

OSF preprints
https://osf.io/preprints


To determine the right license for your scientific output, you can consult for example:

# Subdirectory: Presentations
You can house your presentations, posters, public talks related to the project here. A good practice is to place your ppt into your repository (e.g., OSF) and add a QR code and/or URL to the beginning/end of your presentation so that people can access it after you have delivered the talk.


# Subdirectory: Resources
This subdirectory is to keep reusable visual aids (e.g., figures, logos) to use for presentations, drafts of presentations, public literature, and notes to help create dissemination materials.
