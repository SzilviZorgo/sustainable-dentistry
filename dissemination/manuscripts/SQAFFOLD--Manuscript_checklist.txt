The following is an example of a checklist that an author / authors may need to go through prior to submitting a manuscript:

# Administrative checklist
-all author affiliations are correct
-all affiliations are the same specificity (e.g., university only, university faculty and department)

# Formating and consistency checklist
-in-text references to figure and table numbers are correct
-section numbering is correct
-in-text references to colors within figures are correct
-figure captions and titles are correct and complete
-references to specific jargon are used consistently (example of inconsistency: code scheme vs. coding scheme vs. code structure)
-code labels (human-readable) and/or identifiers (machine-readable) are formatted consistently (e.g., capitalization, italics, etc.)
-narrative fragments (quotes) are displayed consistently (e.g., in quotation marks, in italics)
-all tracked changes are resolved (accepted/rejected/comments removed)
-all URLs work and point to where they should

# Things to do post-submission
-create a preprint (see: SQAFFOLD --> Dissemination)
